Her hands are in and out of water everyday on her job and because the watch is waterproof she doesn't have to worry about it. She loves the comfort of the band ... it doesn't irritate her wrist at all. Especially she loves the angle that the watch head itself sits on the band ... she doesn't even have to turn her wrist to see the time.I couldn't have made a better choice for her lifestyle.

He is a cable technician, and stands and walks and also bends and crawls into small spaces. Goes through boots like crazy.  The tips rip, or they are too heavy, the soles come apart..A few of the other guys in his field had these, so I thought hey..let me take the chance. He loves them..they are alot lighter than Timberlands, and they are flexible.He has only been wearing them a week, so lets see how they hold up..Cross your fingers.I so far would recomend these boots.   \n",

I began to have a lot to talk about in the athletic circles and have made many new friends! I also was able to run faster than I have ever been able to since putting on these shoes! It has inspired me to reach for new goals like trying out for the Olympics! By far these are the best shoes I have owned! I am stronger, faster and more popular and I love it!! I would recommend these shoes to anyone who is looking to change your life!!!   \n",

I searched mulitble websites for sneakers, believe me countless hours online,to my wife's chagrin. I always come back to nike and  the air max line. Brilliant colors, quality product, .foot doc said to walk on hard floors all day like I do to get a hard soled shoe. these have that,yet comfortable. can't wait to wear them and try them out. a must have for sneakerheads like me. ok on to researching the next ones. amazon Rocks.remember they run 1/2 a size small.

My forefoot feels like it's in a vise (yes I adjusted the laces etc.) and NO the shoe will probably NOT &#34;break in&#34; sufficiently to be comfortable.If my old 2013 Flex was a &#34;10&#34; on fit and comfort, I would give this 2014 model a solid &#34;4&#34;. Simply amazing...I am returning these and hoping to find the 2013 model.First and last time I buy a shoe I haven't tried on over the internet...lesson learned!   \n",

They are comfortable, lightweight, and affordable. US Patriot is also an amazing company! After I ordered it on Amazon, I literally got an email like 1 hour later telling me my item has shipped! It actually showed up the next day! I didn't even pay extra for rush delivery! And if I remember correctly, I only paid like $3-4 for shipping. It was absolutely amazing!

This Nike Sandal, I am having for past 1 year+ and definitely comfortable. The problem with sandals they are either too tight or loose. If these are 10% smaller, it would have fit my leg very well :) The groove on bottom keep the leg in a good grip and does not slide off. Washable, so can wear for car wash and dries up easily. Overall I would say try and buy if possible.   \n",
